    <h1>Welcome to the Restaurant Sales & Inventory Demo</h1>
    <p>
        This demo showcases how <strong>Django</strong> can serve as a powerful backend platform for building a real-world
        <strong>inventory and sales reporting system</strong>—perfect for a <strong>small restaurant, food stand, or movie theater</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the examples shown here are simplified for demonstration purposes, they highlight the core functionality needed to build a robust, scalable
        system capable of powering real-world operations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system tracks:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>📦 
            <strong>Ingredient inventory</strong> with live updates as items are sold
        </li>
        <li>🍔 
            <strong>Customer orders</strong> linked to menu items and associated ingredient usage
        </li>
        <li>📊 
            <strong>Daily and custom date range reports</strong> showing revenue, cost, and profit  
        </li>
        <li>📈 
            <strong>Interactive visual dashboards</strong> powered by <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/" target="_blank">Chart.js</a> 
            (e.g. top-selling items, time-of-day sales trends, and profit breakdowns)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Whether you're managing a bustling kitchen or a concessions counter, this prototype illustrates how Django can streamline your operations with
        <strong>data-driven insight and real-time inventory control.</strong>
